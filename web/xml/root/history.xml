	<subtitle>Version: 1.2.7 (ObjectWeb/Multiplan Consultants Ltd) -
        Released: May 02, 2005</subtitle>

        <ul>
          <li>Added optional parameters to specify username and password to be used when running the service.</li>
		  <li>Command format now supports &quot;-user username -password password&quot; parameters.
		  <br/>Both the user and password values must be specified together, or not at all.</li>
		  <li><strong>NOTE</strong> The username value should be specified as a Windows-2000 Active Directory style entry
		  (i.e. <em>johndoe@foobar.com)</em> rather than the usual SMTP-style username; using the incorrect username style may
		  result in &quot;Overlapped I/O operation&quot; errors being reported. The results of this may be different under
		  earlier (Windows NT) or later (Windows XP/2003) system installations - please report any problems if experienced.</li>
		  <li>Extended JVM options check to look for &quot;-cp&quot; and &quot;-classpath&quot; as alternatives
		  to &quot;-Djava.class.path&quot; mechanism, before applying any current CLASSPATH definition to the list of runtime JVM options.
		  This avoids potential problems that may have arisen with the initial V1.2.6 classpath implementation (below).</li>
        </ul>

	<subtitle>Version: 1.2.6 (ObjectWeb/Multiplan Consultants Ltd) -
        Released: April 30, 2005</subtitle>

        <ul>
          <li>Added use of <strong>CLASSPATH</strong> environment variable during service installation, which is added to JVM options
		  if <em>-Djava.class.path</em> is not specified in the original command line (and if CLASSPATH is defined).</li>
		  <li>This feature has been added to avoid problems where the Windows command-line length is exceeded
		  for service configurations that have long lists of class path locations.
		  <br/>
		  Alternative solutions for earlier versions would require manual editing of Registry entries.</li>
		  <li><strong>NOTE</strong> if the <em>-cp</em> or <em>-classpath</em> Java options are specified, this is not checked by the
		  JavaService installation process, so if CLASSPATH exists this will be added as a further option.</li>
        </ul>

	<subtitle>Version: 1.2.5 (ObjectWeb/Multiplan Consultants Ltd) -
        Released: March 10, 2005</subtitle>

        <ul>
          <li>Updated code to append to existing files when redirecting stdout/stderr streams.
		  <br/>
		  <strong>NOTE</strong> this functionality is only available when using a recent Java run-time environment (i.e. JDK 1.4).</li>
		  <li>Internal implementation uses a new constructor for FileOutputStream class, which was added for Java 1.4 JRE.
		  If this new constructor is not available from the run-time environment, the application defaults to the previous
		  mode and uses the standard constructor, which overwrites any existing log files on service startup.</li>
		  <li>This feature has been tested successfully under JDK 1.4.2_07, which appends to existing log files.
		  It has also been tested under JDK 1.3.1_07 and appends to existing files in that environment (not as expected).</li>
		  <li><em>This new release has not yet been tested with an earlier JDK, so the error-handling functionality has not yet
		  been tested to ensure that overwrite mode will be invoked if the new Java feature is not available at run-time.</em>
		  <br/>If problems are found with a JDK prior to 1.3.1_07, then please highlight this through the support forums.</li>
        </ul>
		
	<subtitle>Version: 1.2.4 (ObjectWeb/Multiplan Consultants Ltd) -
        Released: January 29, 2005</subtitle>

        <ul>
          <li>Added the ability to specify the NT service shutdown timeout.
		  <br/>An optional parameter &quot;-shutdown&quot; has been added to the installation command line, allowing the user to specify the
			length of time (in seconds) to allow for the Java method processing on shutdown, before timeout occurs and JVM is terminated.</li>
		  <li>This value is also stored in the registry (milliseconds value) and can be updated using RegEdit.</li>
		  <li>If the value is not found in the registry, the original default of 30 seconds will be used.</li>
		  <li>Decreased the hard-coded value for pause before exit, after JVM has terminated, from 90 to 15 seconds.</li>
        </ul>

	<subtitle>Version: 1.2.3 (Multiplan Consultants Ltd) -
        Released: July 22, 2003</subtitle>

        <ul>
          <li>Added an alternative command-line parameter <strong>-version</strong> <br/>
		  When specified interactively, the program now reports the version number and copyright information.</li>
		  <li>Changes to software build process under Visual Studio:-
		  	<ul>
		  	<li>Additional resource files definitions used, simplifying build of messages resource.</li>
			<li>Version number resource information built into application from source code.</li>
			<li>Debug instance of executable file now renamed to <strong>JavaServiceDebug.exe</strong></li>
			<li>Removed references to unused libraries and include files.</li>
		  	</ul>
		  </li>
          <li>Minor refactoring to the code:-
		  	<ul>
			<li>Local functions and data now restricted to module scope where applicable.</li>
			<li>If/Then/Else statements restructured to meet preferred code-style.</li>
			<li>Some areas of code re-ordered to remove duplication.</li>
			</ul>
		  </li>
		  <li>Product documentation updated:-
		  	<ul>
			<li>All HTML documentation now moved to the <strong>./docs/</strong> sub-directory.</li>
			<li>A new <strong>index.html</strong> page used to reference all other document files.</li>
			<li>Version history information split from the overview document.</li>
			<li>Software build process description updated accordingly.</li>
			<li>Updated Orion sample script to specify initial/maximum heap sizes.</li>
			<li>An initial FAQ has been defined to assist in early fault-finding efforts.</li>
			</ul>
		  </li>
        </ul>
		
	<subtitle>Version: 1.2.2 (Multiplan Consultants Ltd) -
        Released: May 17, 2003</subtitle>

        <ul>
          <li>Added the ability to specify automatic or manual service startup mode.<br/>
            An optional parameter <strong>-auto</strong> or <strong>-manual</strong> has been added to the command line
			to allow the service startup to be specified as automatic (the default) or manual. If manual
			service startup is specified, it will only run when issuing a command of the form <em>net start service</em>.</li>
          <li>Added an example of using the JavaService program to run the JBoss server software.</li>
          <li>Further changes to printf statements to show the service name used.</li>
        </ul>


	<subtitle>Version: 1.2.1 (Multiplan Consultants Ltd) -
        Released: November 03, 2002</subtitle>

        <ul>
          <li>Added the ability to specify an NT service dependency.<br />
            An optional parameter <strong>-depends</strong> has been added to the command line so that the user can specify an
			additional NT service that must be started before the registered Java service is run.</li>
          <li>Added new-line characters to the end of some printf statements to improve log file output.</li>
          <li>Fixed an unitialised pointer problem that resulted in an occasional memory access error.</li>
          <li>Added an example of using the JavaService program to run the Orion Application Server as a service.</li>
        </ul>


	<subtitle>Version: 1.2.0 (Alexandria Software Consulting) -
          Released: April 12, 2001</subtitle>

        <ul>
          <li>Added the ability to have registry values greater than 256 characters. 
            Registry access is now fully dynamic and values can have any length. 
            A lot of people were having problems with the 256 character limit. 
            I'm sorry it took so long to fix that, but I've been busy.</li>
          <li>Fixed several printf statements that were missing parameters. Thanks 
            to Anthony Tagunov for catching this.</li>
          <li>Fixed a problem that prevented registry errors from being displayed 
            properly. Thanks to Lars Johanson for sending in a fix for this.</li>
          <li>Fixed a missing parameter in the Tomcat 3.2 install batch file. 
            This is untested as I don't use Tomcat 3.2, so if someone would let 
            me know if it works or not, I would appreciate it. Thanks to Joe Siebenmann 
            for pointing out that there was a problem with the old batch file.</li>
          <li>Added a new parameter &quot;-current&quot; to allow the current 
            working directory to be specified. There were some people having problems 
            with code that used relative paths, so this should help them out.</li>
          <li>Added a new parameter &quot;-path&quot; to allow for extra path 
            information to be added for finding dependent DLLs. Thanks to Lars 
            Johanson for this submission.</li>
        </ul>

            the system.</li>
        </ul>
