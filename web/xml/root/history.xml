	<subtitle>Version: 1.2.0 (Alexandria Software Consulting) -
          Release Date: April 12, 2001</subtitle>

        <ul>
          <li>Added the ability to have registry values greater than 256 characters. 
            Registry access is now fully dynamic and values can have any length. 
            A lot of people were having problems with the 256 character limit. 
            I'm sorry it took so long to fix that, but I've been busy.</li>
          <li>Fixed several printf statements that were missing parameters. Thanks 
            to Anthony Tagunov for catching this.</li>
          <li>Fixed a problem that prevented registry errors from being displayed 
            properly. Thanks to Lars Johanson for sending in a fix for this.</li>
          <li>Fixed a missing parameter in the Tomcat 3.2 install batch file. 
            This is untested as I don't use Tomcat 3.2, so if someone would let 
            me know if it works or not, I would appreciate it. Thanks to Joe Siebenmann 
            for pointing out that there was a problem with the old batch file.</li>
          <li>Added a new parameter &quot;-current&quot; to allow the current 
            working directory to be specified. There were some people having problems 
            with code that used relative paths, so this should help them out.</li>
          <li>Added a new parameter &quot;-path&quot; to allow for extra path 
            information to be added for finding dependent DLLs. Thanks to Lars 
            Johanson for this submission.</li>
        </ul>
