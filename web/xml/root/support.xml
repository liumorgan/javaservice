                <p>The JavaService software is supported through the use of the community tools at
				the ObjectWeb Forge for this project. As an open source project, external contributions are
				welcomed as a means to improving and extending the software capability and usability.</p>
				
				<p>If you require support, the best way to find a solution is to browse the forums and if needed, enter your own question.</p>

                <p>If you have need of a new feature that is not implemented within the current version of JavaService,
				you can also suggest this as an enhancement or new development.</p>
				
				<p>The project forums are available <a href="http://forge.objectweb.org/forum/?group_id=137">here</a>
				and the mailing list can be accessed <a href="http://forge.objectweb.org/mail/?group_id=137">here</a> for any issues
				related to JavaService.</p>
