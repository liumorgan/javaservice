	<subtitle>A blank section - so far!</subtitle>
	<p>This section of the site is to include lists of people and/or companies that have used the
	JavaService software for their applications - either in development or production environments.</p>
	
	<p>This information has not been requested before, so there is no official list at present.
	But it is know that the software is used in many companies, for many different uses. If you are
	one of those many users of JavaService, please send in some information to be listed here...</p>

    </s1>

    <s1 name="Web References">

	<p>JavaService is described and referenced from various web locations and install guides.
	Web references will be added here to link the ObjectWeb site with those other resources.</p>
	
	<p>To start with, you can always use the Google search engine to get your own resource list,
	simply by specifying the keyword <strong>JavaService</strong>, as in
	<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=javaservice">this link</a>.</p>
