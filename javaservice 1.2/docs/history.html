        <p class="mainBold">Version: 1.2.2 (Multiplan Consultants Ltd)<br>
          Release Date: May 17, 2003</p>
        <ul class="mainNormal">
          <li>Added the ability to specify automatic or manual service startup mode.<br>
            An optional parameter &quot;-auto&quot; or &quot;-manual&quot; has been added to the command line
			to allow the service startup to be specified as automatic (the default) or manual. If manual
			service startup is specified, it will only run when issuing a command of the form 'net start service'.</li>
          <li>Added an example of using the JavaService program to run the JBoss server software.</li>
          <li>Further changes to printf statements to show the service name used.</li>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mainBold">Version: 1.2.1 (Multiplan Consultants Ltd)<br>
          Release Date: November 03, 2002</p>
        <ul class="mainNormal">
          <li>Added the ability to specify an NT service dependency.<br>
            An optional parameter &quot;-depends&quot; has been added to the command line so that the user can specify an
			additional NT service that must be started before the registered Java service is run.</li>
          <li>Added new-line characters to the end of some printf statements to improve log file output.</li>
          <li>Fixed an unitialised pointer problem that resulted in an occasional memory access error.</li>
          <li>Added an example of using the JavaService program to run the Orion Application Server as a service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mainBold"></p>
        <p class="mainBold">Version: 1.2.0 (Alexandria Software Consulting)<br>
          Release Date: April 12, 2001</p>
        <ul class="mainNormal">
          <li>Added the ability to have registry values greater than 256 characters. 
            Registry access is now fully dynamic and values can have any length. 
            A lot of people were having problems with the 256 character limit. 
            I'm sorry it took so long to fix that, but I've been busy.</li>
          <li>Fixed several printf statements that were missing parameters. Thanks 
            to Anthony Tagunov for catching this.</li>
          <li>Fixed a problem that prevented registry errors from being displayed 
            properly. Thanks to Lars Johanson for sending in a fix for this.</li>
          <li>Fixed a missing parameter in the Tomcat 3.2 install batch file. 
            This is untested as I don't use Tomcat 3.2, so if someone would let 
            me know if it works or not, I would appreciate it. Thanks to Joe Siebenmann 
            for pointing out that there was a problem with the old batch file.</li>
          <li>Added a new parameter &quot;-current&quot; to allow the current 
            working directory to be specified. There were some people having problems 
            with code that used relative paths, so this should help them out.</li>
          <li>Added a new parameter &quot;-path&quot; to allow for extra path 
            information to be added for finding dependent DLLs. Thanks to Lars 
            Johanson for this submission.</li>
        </ul>

            the system.</li>
        </ul>

      <p class="mainBold"><a name="To_Do"></a>To Do</p>

      <p class="mainNormal">The following features have been noted as possible enhancements that
	  may be included in a future release of the JavaService software.</p>
      <ul class="mainNormal">
          <li>Define configuration options for the start and stop method timeouts, which are
		  currently hard-coded as constant values of 30 seconds each. When these timeouts are
		  exceeded, the JVM is terminated.</li>
		  <li>Implement optional parameter to allow program to be run interactively, but
		  using the same configuration parameters as when run as a service. (i.e. <em>-interactive</em> option
		  in same format as <em>-install</em> option to allow for improved test environment.</li>
		  <li>Provide some form of service interrogation interface, to allow the state of
		  the service to be verified by the user. Either use a simple http web-server mode,
		  or a Windows system management interface.</li>
		  <li>Add a heap memory report, which must work across all JVMs, with the value(s)
		  being reported either on request or as an additional Event Log message on shutdown.</li>
		  <li>Create improved scripts for install and uninstall of generic programs</li>
		  <li>Improve and extend the set of example scripts for other known products, to include
		  JOnAS, J-Integra, Hyperion Application Link, plus later versions of existing products.</li>
