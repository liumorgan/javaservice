As a very simple summary, the LGPL licensing terms allow you to use the JavaService software in both commercial and non-commercial environments,
at no charge. The software may be bundled with commercial products or applications, so long as the LGPL licence is included for JavaService.
You are not permitted to charge for derivations of the JavaService software, which must be provided on an Open Source basis.
</p>

<p>
Information about the JavaService software is available at the ObjectWeb web site.
Refer to <A HREF="http://javaservice.objectweb.org">http://javaservice.objectweb.org</A> for more details.
</p>

<p>
This software is derived from earlier work by Alexandria Software Consulting,
(no longer contactable) which was released under a BSD-style license in 2001.
</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p>
As indicated in the associated licensing terms, this software is supplied 'as is' and is not covered by any support agreements or obligations.
<br>
Informal support is available from the ObjectWeb project pages
(<A HREF="http://javaservice.objectweb.org">http://javaservice.objectweb.org</A>) where you may find assistance
for any problems you may experience in the use of the JavaService software.
</p>

<p>
As the software is provided as an Open Source project, you also have recourse to the original source code should you need to investigate
issues or problems that arise in your own particular environment.
