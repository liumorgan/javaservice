<h2>JavaService - Release History</h2>

<h3>Latest Release</h4>
<h4>Version 2.0.4 - 21st August 2005</h4>

<p>
This release of JavaService is based on the new Version 2 code base.
<br>
Hence it should initially be viewed as 'release candidate' status and not used for production software
environment until suitable testing and verification has been performed.
</p>
<p>
This version incorporates refactored code and additional commands, whilst maintaining complete
backwards compatibility with V1.2 commands and configuration entries. The benefits of the new
code base are aimed to support easier enhancements with new functionality. There is also a reduction of
code duplication, which should in turn reduce the possibilities for errors and improve the
maintainability of the application software.
</p>
<p>
The following new commands are included in this release:-
</p>
<dl>
<dt>-queryconfig servicename</dt>
<dd>To view the configuration entries for the named Java service</dd>
<dt>-status servicename</dt>
<dd>To display the current execution status of the named Java service</dd>
<dt>-licence</dt>
<dd>To output the LGPL licence text from JavaService</dd>
<dt>-help command</dt>
<dd>Displaying further help details for the specified command</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The software has been tested using the SampleService code and has undergone debug testing to
verify internal operation. The interface at the Windows Service level has been improved, whilst
maintaining the same Registry and Java JNI interfaces as used by previous releases of JavaService.
</p>


<h3>Previous Release</h3>
<h4>Version 1.2.12 - 1st August 2005</h4>

<p>
This is the final planned release of the JavaService utility from the Version 1.x code base.
</p>
<p>
It can be viewed as a 'stable' release, with the code having been used in essentially the
same form for a number of years, with only minor internal changes at each release level.
</p>
<p>
Refer to V1.x documentation for release notes and prior change history.
</p>

<h3>Version Numbering</h3>

<p>
Releases of the JavaService product code are given a three-part version number, which is
incorporated in the binary image of the program as well as being used in the source control system.
There is a fourth part to the version number, used for internal build release tracking only.
</p>
<p>
The meaning of each part of the version number is explained below, using V2.0.4.0 as an example:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Version Part</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First (2)</td><td>Major version number indicating codebase of the software</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Second (0)</td><td>Minor version number for directly-compatible releases</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third (4)</td><td>Incremental version number for patch releases of software</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fourth (0)</td><td>Build tracking number, may be used for custom builds</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Compatibility will be maintained between releases of software with the same major version numbers,
unless there is a particular problem identified and resolved in the later release. Software releases
with the same major and minor release numbers shall be compatible in all cases (accepting that
additional functionality may be included in the later release).
