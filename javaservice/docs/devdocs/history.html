<h2>JavaService - Release History</h2>

<h3>Latest Release Candidate</h4>
<h4>Version 2.0.6 - 29th September 2005</h4>

<p>
This release of JavaService is based on the new Version 2 code base.
<br>
There has only been one reported problem from Version 2 code, which has been addressed in this release.
Until further testing is completed this should still be viewed as <b>release candidate</b> code...
</p>

<h5>New Features</h5>

<p>
No new features included in this release - internal changes only.
</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<p>
<i>303998</i>
<strong>Overlapped I/O operation in progress</strong>
<br>
This problem arose when a service was installed without specifying a shutdown class in the configuration.
Code changes have been incorporated to treat this correctly as an optional parameter.
Improvements have also been made to error detection and handling in this area of code.
</p>

<h5>Known Problems</h5>

<p>
No further known problems with this release.
<br>
If no new reports are received, the Version 2 codebase will be moved to 'stable release' status.
</p>

<h5>Compatibility</h5>

<p>
Backwards-compatible with V2.0 and V1.2 releases of JavaService.
</p>


<h3>Preceding Releases</h4>

<h4>Version 2.0.5 - 30th August 2005</h4>

<p>
This release of JavaService is based on the new Version 2 code base.
<br>
There has only been one reported problem from Version 2 code, but until further testing is
completed this should still be viewed as <b>release candidate</b> code...
</p>

<h5>New Features</h5>

<p>
No new features included in this release - internal changes only.
</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<p>
<strong>Error Message Output</strong>
<br>
A problem was detected (not reported) with output of error messages when failing to install a service.
This release fixes this problem so that the correct error message text is displayed on any failure.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Overlapped I/O operation in progress</strong>
<br>
Some minor code changes have been incorporated towards finding and resolving the cause of this
intermittent problem.
</p>

<h5>Known Problems</h5>

<p>
There has been a single report of a '<i>Overlapped I/O operation in progress</i>' error message when attempting
to install the CruiseControl service. This does not appear in testing with the SampleService code and
is being investigated further. Some changes have been included in this release to work towards a fix.
</p>

<h5>Compatibility</h5>

<p>
Backwards-compatible with V2.0.4 and V1.2.12 (and earlier) releases of JavaService.
</p>


<h4>Version 2.0.4 - 21st August 2005</h4>

<p>
This version of JavaService is the first official release to be based on the new Version 2 code base.
<br>
Hence it should initially be viewed as 'release candidate' status and not used for production software
environment until suitable testing and verification has been performed.
</p>


<h5>New Features</h5>

<p>
This version incorporates refactored code and additional commands, whilst maintaining complete
backwards compatibility with V1.2 commands and configuration entries. The benefits of the new
code base are aimed to support easier enhancements with new functionality. There is also a reduction of
code duplication, which should in turn reduce the possibilities for errors and improve the
maintainability of the application software.
</p>
<p>
The following new commands are included in this release:-
</p>
<dl>
<dt>-queryconfig servicename</dt>
<dd>To view the configuration entries for the named Java service</dd>
<dt>-status servicename</dt>
<dd>To display the current execution status of the named Java service</dd>
<dt>-licence</dt>
<dd>To output the LGPL licence text from JavaService</dd>
<dt>-help command</dt>
<dd>Displaying further help details for the specified command</dd>
</dl>
<p>
The software has been tested using the SampleService code and has undergone debug testing to
verify internal operation. The interface at the Windows Service level has been improved, whilst
maintaining the same Registry and Java JNI interfaces as used by previous releases of JavaService.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, using the JavaServiceDebug executable will generated debug-type output to a log file
for fault investigation. At present, this filename is fixed internally as <code>C:\javaservice.log</code>
</p>

<h5>Bug Fixes</h5>

<p>
There are no specific bug fixes included within this release.

<h3>Previous Stable Release</h3>
<h4>Version 1.2.12 - 1st August 2005</h4>

<p>
This is the final planned release of the JavaService utility from the Version 1.x code base.
</p>
<p>
It can be viewed as a 'stable' release, with the code having been used in essentially the
same form for a number of years, with limited internal changes at each release level.
</p>
<p>
Refer to V1.x documentation for release notes and prior change history.
</p>

<h3>Version Numbering</h3>

<p>
Releases of the JavaService product code are given a three-part version number, which is
incorporated in the binary image of the program as well as being used in the source control system.
There is a fourth part to the version number, used for internal build release tracking only.
</p>
<p>
The meaning of each part of the version number is explained below, using V2.0.4.0 as an example:
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Version Part</strong></td><td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>First (2)</td><td>Major version number indicating codebase of the software</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Second (0)</td><td>Minor version number for directly-compatible releases</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Third (4)</td><td>Incremental version number for patch releases of software</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fourth (0)</td><td>Build tracking number, may be used for custom builds</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
Compatibility will be maintained between releases of software with the same major version numbers,
unless there is a particular problem identified and resolved in the later release. Software releases
with the same major and minor release numbers shall be compatible in all cases (accepting that
additional functionality may be included in the later release).
